const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7];

// const part = numbers.slice(1, 4);
// const removed = numbers.splice(1,4,);
// console.log(removed);

// Slice start to end previous. It won't be removed from array!
// splice start to selected numbers it will totally removed from array. also i can add some new items there!

const together = numbers.join(" ");
console.log(together);

// Whatever i add on join it will add beside array items!
